jappstart is a Java framework for Google App Engine built on Spring,
Spring Security, and Sitemesh. The project aims to be the starting
point for Google App Engine Java applications. It's not a framework
in the traditional sense -- rather it is designed to provide a solid
foundation for GAE/Java applications that can be easily extended by
developers.
