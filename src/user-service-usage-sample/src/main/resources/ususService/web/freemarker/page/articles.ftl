  <h2>Preparing for a Fancy Dress Ball</h2>
  <p>
  Preparing for a Fancy Dress Ball, also known as The Misses Williams-Wynn,[1] is a 173 by 150 cm (68 by 59 in) oil on canvas by English artist William Etty, first exhibited in 1835 and currently in the York Art Gallery.
  Although Etty was then known almost exclusively for history paintings featuring nude figures, he was commissioned in 1833 by Welsh Conservative politician Charles Watkin Williams-Wynn to paint a portrait of two of his daughters.
  Preparing for a Fancy Dress Ball shows Williams-Wynn's daughters, Charlotte and Mary, in lavish Italian-style costume: Charlotte, the eldest, is shown standing, helping the seated Mary decorate her hair with a ribbon and a rose.
  Etty put a good deal of effort into the piece and took much longer than usual to finish it.
  </p>
  <p>
  The painting was completed for and exhibited at the 1835 Royal Academy Summer Exhibition.
  It was generally well received, even by critics usually hostile to Etty and his work.
  Preparing for a Fancy Dress Ball demonstrated that Etty was both capable of high-quality work and deserving of patronage by the English elite, and the success led to further commissions. The painting remained in the collection of Mary Williams-Wynn's descendants, and other than an 1849 retrospective exhibition, was not shown publicly for 160 years.
  A private collector purchased the piece from the Williams-Wynn family in 1982, where it remained until its 2009 acquisition by the York Art Gallery, where it now forms part of a major collection of Etty's work.

  <h2>William M. Mitchell</h2>
  <p>
  Mitchell was raised as an orphan in North Carolina. His birth date is about 1826.[2]
  </p>
  <p>
  He was apprenticed to a plantation owner where he was obliged to help in administering their slaves.[3]
  </p>
  <p>
  He became involved in the resistance to slavery in 1843 when he was among a crowd of people who intimidated some bounty hunters who were returning an escaped slave to his owners. The man regained his freedom when his captors fled. Mitchell later reported that the man, who had a wife and children, had been given away by the local white pastor who claimed a $100 bounty.[3]
  </p>
  <p>
  Mitchell was an active supporter of the movement that was smuggling escaped slaves from the American South to Canada before the 1860s American Civil War. He said that he was most active when he was living in the city of Washington Court House in Fayette County, Ohio. His house was a safe house for John Mason who brought 265 escapees to Mitchell's home.[3]
  </p>
  <p>
  Mitchell is said to be the only writer who wrote about the Underground Railroad while it was still illegal,[1] although others had described it at an earlier date. The British writer Harriet Martineau had mentioned the concept in 1837 and the British abolitionist Joseph Sturge wrote about it in 1841, but they did not name it. Mitchell's book took the name of the Underground Railroad into his book's title, although the phrase had been used before[4] by James Stirling in 1857.[5] Mitchell's book was published in London in 1860.[4] Mitchell's book garnered recommendations from leading abolitionists including the American activist William Howard Day and the British politician George Thompson.[6]
  </p>
  <p>
  Mitchell was a minister in Toronto with the American Baptist Free Mission Society. He visited Britain in 1859 where he toured with the Reverend William Troy. The two of them both wrote books and they went on lecture tours of anti-slavery groups in Ireland, Scotland and England and gathered funds for their churches in Canada. Mitchell's book particularly thanked the Glasgow Emancipation Society who supported his work and his book.[6]
  </p>
  <p>
  Despite the death of his daughter, Mitchell traveled again to Great Britain in 1863 to 1864 when a controversy erupted over his poor accounting and the potential mixing of his expenses with the hundreds of pounds (sterling) that he was meant to be sending back to Canada. Mitchell and his family are presumed to have returned to America. One record shows that he died before 1879 but there is no further detail.[2]

  <h2>Beijing</h2>
  <p>
  Beijing is the capital of the People's Republic of China and one of the most populous cities in the world. The population as of 2013 was 21,150,000.[8] The city proper is the 3rd largest in the world. The metropolis, located in northern China, is governed as a direct-controlled municipality under the national government, with 14 urban and suburban districts and two rural counties.[9] Beijing Municipality is surrounded by Hebei Province with the exception of neighboring Tianjin Municipality to the southeast.[10]
  </p>
  <p>
  Beijing is the second largest Chinese city by urban population after Shanghai and is the nation's political, cultural, and educational center.[11] It is home to the headquarters of most of China's largest state-owned companies, and is a major hub for the national highway, expressway, railway, and high-speed rail networks. The Beijing Capital International Airport is the second busiest in the world by passenger traffic.[12]
  </p>
  <p>
  The city's history dates back three millennia. As the last of the Four Great Ancient Capitals of China, Beijing has been the political center of the country for much of the past eight centuries.[13] The city is renowned for its opulent palaces, temples, parks and gardens, tombs, walls and gates,[14] and its art treasures and universities have made it a center of culture and art in China.[14] Encyclopædia Britannica notes that "few cities in the world have served for so long as the political headquarters and cultural centre of an area as immense as China."[15] Beijing has seven UNESCO World Heritage Sites – the Forbidden City, Temple of Heaven, Summer Palace, Ming Tombs, Zhoukoudian, Great Wall, and the Grand Canal.[16]
  </p>
  <p>
  Beijing hosted the 2008 Summer Olympics and was chosen to host the 2022 Winter Olympics, making it the only city to host both events.[17]

  <h2>Lughnasadh</h2>
  <p>
  Lughnasadh or Lughnasa (pronounced /ˈluːnəsə/, loo-nə-sə; Irish: Lúnasa, /ˈl̪ˠuːn̪ˠəsˠə/; Scottish Gaelic: Lùnastal, [ˈl̪ˠu:nəsd̥əl̪ˠ]; Manx: Luanistyn, [ˈluanɪst̪ən]) is a Gaelic festival marking the beginning of the harvest season. Historically, it was widely observed throughout Ireland, Scotland and the Isle of Man. Originally it was held on 1 August, or about halfway between the summer solstice and autumn equinox. However, over time the celebrations shifted to the Sundays nearest this date. Lughnasadh is one of the four Gaelic seasonal festivals; along with Samhain, Imbolc and Beltane. It corresponds to other European harvest festivals such as the Welsh Gwyl Awst and the English Lammas.
  </p>
  <p>
  Lughnasadh is mentioned in some of the earliest Irish literature and is believed to have pagan origins. The festival itself is named after the god Lugh. It involved great gatherings that included religious ceremonies, ritual athletic contests (most notably the Tailteann Games), feasting, matchmaking and trading. There were also visits to holy wells. According to folklorist Máire MacNeill, evidence shows that the religious rites included an offering of the first of the corn, a feast of the new food and of bilberries, the sacrifice of a bull and a ritual dance-play. Much of this would have taken place on top of hills and mountains.
  </p>
  <p>
  Lughnasadh customs persisted widely until the 20th century, with the event being variously named 'Garland Sunday', 'Bilberry Sunday', 'Mountain Sunday' and 'Crom Dubh Sunday'. The custom of climbing hills and mountains at Lughnasadh has survived in some areas, although it has been re-cast as a Christian pilgrimage. The best known is the 'Reek Sunday' pilgrimage to the top of Croagh Patrick on the last Sunday in July. A number of fairs are also believed to be survivals of Lughnasadh, for example the Puck Fair. Since the later 20th century, Celtic neopagans have observed Lughnasadh, or something based on it, as a religious holiday. In some places, elements of the festival have been revived as a cultural event.
