## Demo

This sample project illustrates how to use auto-generated resources in maven.

```
mvn clean compile exec:java
```

should output something like

```
===
sample.properties content:
greeting=Hello
farewell=Bye

===
compile-date.txt content:
Sun Jul 12 21:34:15 PDT 2015
```

The second resource is autogenerated one.
